#question1
*input=> Number
Logic => result = Number * Number ==> VARIABLE
output => result (square)

# Question 2
*Input => 
   Logic => 1. Look the time of your system
            2. It will take time in 24hrs format==> store the time, that is VARIABLE
            3. If time is in between 08:00 - 10:00
time for breakfast(condition)
            4. If time is in between 12:00 - 15:00 then its time for lunch(CONDITION)
            5. If time is in between 20:00 - 22:00 then its time for dinner(CONDITION)
            6. Else say, "don;t do anything"(CONDITION)
    output => Breakfast/Lunch ?dinner        

# Question 3
* Input => Number 
    logic => 1. check the number, and divide it by 2. ===> VARIABLE
             2. if it is divisible by 2 then it is even number (CONDITION)
             3. else it is odd number (CONDITION)
    Output => Odd/Even

 # Question 4 (palindrome)
 * Input => Number/string
    logic=> 1. Reverse the input and save it as result. VARIABLE
    2. check if result is equal to input==> (CONDITION) 
    3. if it is equal then say true/it is palindrome.==> (CONDITION)
    4. Else False/not a palindrome. CONDITION
  output => True/False

  # Question 5 (Fibonaci series) 1,1,2,3,5,8,13, 
  * Input => Nothing/
        logic => 1. Keep a coun t starting from 0. ===>VARIABLE
        2. New _number = add last number with current number. ===> VARIABLE
        3. Increment the count by 1 => Count = count +1
        4. End this thing when count reaches 10.===> LOOPING
        5. return me the last number .
    Output => Last number/ 55
